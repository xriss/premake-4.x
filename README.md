puremake is a version of premake4 in pure lua
---------------------------------------------

See https://premake.github.io/ for premake4 documentation.

I've renamed it to puremake so as not to confuse it with premake5. My 
intent is to keep it compatible with premake4 but wrap it up into more 
of a lua module or rock for easy install.

The only binary dependency is a version of lua(JIT) and the 
lua-filesystem (lfs) library.

Prebuilt lua and lfs binaries for various OS exist and are easily 
available as they have been stable for years.

For example

	./apt-get-install.sh

will install luajit and lfs using apt-get

	./puremake.sh

will run premake4 using the installed luajit

	./puremake.lua

will also run premake4 but this file is a completely self contained lua 
script containing amalgamated files from the src directory and is 
generated by the ```./build.sh``` script. This *single* lua file can be 
taken out of this repository and used as a portable pure lua 
replacement for a premake4 binary.

Personally I'm happy to include this snapshot of premake4 lua code in 
my projects rather than require premake4 to be made available in the 
build environment. It's just one less thing that can go wrong when 
building code.

It all depends on your needs, maybe the standard premake4 fat 
executable is best for you, but I think it is nice to have puremake as 
a pure lua premake4 option that reduces the complexity of getting my 
code to build.
